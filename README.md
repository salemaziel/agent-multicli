**An MCP server that lets Claude, Gemini, Codex, and OpenCode call each other as tools.**

```
Claude:   "Hey Gemini, what do you think about this code?"
Gemini:   "It's mass. Let me ask Codex for a second opinion."
Codex:    "You're both wrong. Here's the fix."
OpenCode: "I checked with three providers. They all agree with Codex."
```

---

## One-Line Install (macOS / Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osanoai/multicli/main/install.sh | bash
```

Detects which AI CLIs you have installed and configures Multi-CLI for them automatically.

- Claude Code is configured to use a per-user local HTTP service on `127.0.0.1`
- Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, and OpenCode keep using stdio/local config by default
- The installer may update client config files on your behalf

---

## What It Does

Multi-CLI sits between your AI clients and bridges them via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Install it once, and whichever AI you're talking to gains the ability to call the others.

- **Claude** can ask Gemini, Codex, or OpenCode for help
- **Gemini** can delegate to Claude, Codex, or OpenCode
- **Codex** can consult Claude, Gemini, or OpenCode
- **OpenCode** can call Claude, Gemini, or Codex (across 75+ providers)
- Each client's own tools are hidden (no talking to yourself, that's weird)
- Auto-detects which CLIs you have installed — only shows what's available

---

## The Meta Part

This tool was built by the very AIs it connects.

Claude, Gemini, Codex, and OpenCode wrote the code. Claude, Gemini, Codex, and OpenCode maintain it. Every night, a CI job queries the latest stable release of each CLI for its current model list, diffs the results against what's in the repo, and automatically publishes a new version if anything changed. New model releases get picked up within 24 hours. Deprecated models get cleaned out. The repo stays current without anyone touching it.

The stdio install paths use `@latest`, so those clients pick up new releases automatically. Claude Code's managed HTTP service intentionally runs from a stable installed runtime instead of a transient `npx` cache; rerun the installer or `multicli service refresh --configure-claude` after upgrading.

Most MCP tools go stale within weeks. This one is self-maintaining by design.

---

## Prerequisites

You need **Node.js >= 20** and at least **one** of these CLIs installed:

| CLI | Install |
|-----|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) | `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash` |

> Multi-CLI is most useful with two or more CLIs installed. With only one, the install still works, but there may be nothing to bridge yet.

---

## Manual Installation

Prefer to install per-client yourself? Each command is one line.

### Claude Code

Recommended for Claude Code stability:

```bash
npm install -g @osanoai/multicli
multicli service install --configure-claude
```

This installs a per-user background service that listens only on `127.0.0.1`, configures Claude Code to use Multi-CLI over HTTP, and keeps the underlying server alive even if Claude drops a stdio subprocess.

The managed service installs as a per-user login/background service:

- macOS: `launchd` LaunchAgent
- Ubuntu/Debian: `systemd --user`
- Windows: Scheduled Task at user logon

Security model:

- Listens only on `127.0.0.1`
- Uses `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for every HTTP MCP request
- Stores generated service artifacts in a user-owned service directory

Operational notes:

- `multicli service install` refuses transient `npx` runtimes; use a global install or a stable local checkout
- Generated service state includes an env file you can edit if your local AI CLIs require additional credentials or PATH entries
- On Linux, the default `systemd --user` service follows your login session; enable `linger` yourself only if you intentionally want it to stay up after logout

Legacy stdio installation is still available:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user Multi-CLI -- npx -y @osanoai/multicli@latest
```

<details>
<summary>Claude Desktop (JSON config)</summary>

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Multi-CLI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@osanoai/multicli@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop completely after saving.
</details>

---

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini mcp add --scope user Multi-CLI npx -y @osanoai/multicli@latest
```

<details>
<summary>Manual config (~/.gemini/settings.json)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Multi-CLI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@osanoai/multicli@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

---

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex mcp add Multi-CLI -- npx -y @osanoai/multicli@latest
```

<details>
<summary>Manual config (~/.codex/config.toml) or pass --mcp-config</summary>

```bash
codex --mcp-config mcp.json
```

Where `mcp.json` contains:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Multi-CLI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@osanoai/multicli@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

---

### OpenCode

OpenCode's `mcp add` command is interactive, so add Multi-CLI to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` directly:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "Multi-CLI": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@osanoai/multicli@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

If the file already exists, merge the `"Multi-CLI"` entry into the existing `"mcp"` object.

---

### Any Other MCP Client

Multi-CLI supports both stdio and Streamable HTTP.

For stdio-capable clients, point them at:

```
npx -y @osanoai/multicli@latest
```

For a managed local HTTP service, install Multi-CLI globally and run:

```bash
multicli service install
```

The service listens on `127.0.0.1` only and exposes `/mcp` plus `/health`.

## Available Tools

Once connected, your AI client gains access to tools for the *other* CLIs (never its own):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `List-Gemini-Models` | List available Gemini models and their strengths |
| `Ask-Gemini` | Ask-Gemini a question or give it a task |
| `Fetch-Chunk` | Retrieve chunked responses from Gemini |
| `Gemini-Help` | Get Gemini CLI help info |
| `List-Codex-Models` | List available Codex models |
| `Ask-Codex` | Ask-Codex a question or give it a task |
| `Codex-Help` | Get Codex CLI help info |
| `List-Claude-Models` | List available Claude models |
| `Ask-Claude` | Ask-Claude a question or give it a task |
| `Claude-Help` | Get Claude Code CLI help info |
| `List-OpenCode-Models` | List available OpenCode models from all configured providers |
| `Ask-OpenCode` | Ask-OpenCode a question or give it a task |
| `OpenCode-Help` | Get OpenCode CLI help info |

---

## Task-Capable Ask Tools

The `Ask-*` tools still work as normal synchronous MCP tools, but they now also advertise optional task-based execution for MCP clients that support tasks.

- Task-capable clients can run long `Ask-*` calls using MCP tasks to avoid long blocking tool requests
- Older clients keep using the same `Ask-*` tools synchronously with no config changes
- `List-*`, `*-Help`, and `Fetch-Chunk` remain normal synchronous tools

---

## Usage Examples

Once installed, just talk naturally to your AI:

```
"Ask-Gemini what it thinks about this architecture"
"Have Codex review this function for performance issues"
"Get Claude's opinion on this error message"
"Use OpenCode to get a second opinion from Llama"
```

Or get a second opinion on anything:

```
"I want three perspectives on how to refactor this module —
 ask Gemini and Codex what they'd do differently"
```

---

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     MCP (stdio)      ┌──────────────┐     CLI calls    ┌─────────────┐
│  Your AI    │ ◄──────────────────► │  Multi-CLI   │ ───────────────► │ Other AIs   │
│  Client     │                      │   server     │                  │ (CLI tools) │
└─────────────┘                      └──────────────┘                  └─────────────┘

1. Your AI client connects to Multi-CLI via MCP
2. Multi-CLI detects which CLIs are installed on your system
3. It registers tools for the OTHER clients (hides tools for the calling client)
4. When a tool is called, Multi-CLI executes the corresponding CLI command
5. Results flow back through MCP to your AI client
```

For Claude Code, Multi-CLI can also run as a local background HTTP service:

```
┌─────────────┐     MCP (HTTP)       ┌──────────────┐     CLI calls    ┌─────────────┐
│ Claude Code │ ◄──────────────────► │  Multi-CLI   │ ───────────────► │ Other AIs   │
│   Client    │    127.0.0.1 only    │   service    │                  │ (CLI tools) │
└─────────────┘                      └──────────────┘                  └─────────────┘
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No usable AI CLIs detected"**
Make sure at least one other CLI is installed and on your PATH:
```bash
which gemini && which codex && which claude && which opencode
```

**No tools showing up?**
If only your own CLI is installed, Multi-CLI hides it (no self-calls). Install a *different* CLI to enable cross-model collaboration.

**MCP server not responding?**
1. Check that Node.js >= 20 is installed
2. Run `npx -y @osanoai/multicli@latest` directly to see if the stdio server starts
3. Restart your AI client completely

**Claude Code disconnecting after successful calls?**
Use the managed background service instead of the legacy stdio integration:

```bash
npm install -g @osanoai/multicli
multicli service install --configure-claude
multicli service doctor
```

Helpful service commands:

- `multicli service status`
- `multicli service doctor`
- `multicli service logs`
- `multicli service refresh`
- `multicli service uninstall`

**Need to tune timeouts or cleanup behavior?**
Multi-CLI supports these optional environment variables:

- `MULTICLI_TRANSPORT` (`stdio` or `http`)
- `MULTICLI_ASK_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `MULTICLI_HELP_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `MULTICLI_CLI_DETECT_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `MULTICLI_KILL_GRACE_MS`
- `MULTICLI_HTTP_HOST` (defaults to `127.0.0.1`)
- `MULTICLI_HTTP_PORT` (defaults to `37420`)
- `MULTICLI_HTTP_PATH` (defaults to `/mcp`)
- `MULTICLI_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` (required for direct HTTP mode)
- `MULTICLI_HTTP_SESSION_IDLE_MS`
- `MULTICLI_LOG_PATH` (defaults to `~/.multicli/logs/multicli.log`)
- `MULTICLI_LOG_LEVEL` (`error`, `info`, or `debug`; defaults to `debug` for the file log)
- `MULTICLI_STDERR_LOG_LEVEL` (`silent`, `error`, `info`, or `debug`; defaults to `error`)
- `MULTICLI_SERVICE_ROOT_DIR`
- `MULTICLI_SERVICE_LOG_PATH`
- `MULTICLI_SERVICE_ENV_PATH`
- `MULTICLI_SERVICE_RUNTIME_PATH`

The server writes structured JSON-line logs to a single file destination, rotates them automatically for long-running service mode, and includes full prompt bodies for `Ask-*` requests so disconnects and crashes can be reconstructed after the fact.
